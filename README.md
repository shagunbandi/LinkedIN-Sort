# LinkedIn-Sort

Will sort the csv exported from LinkedIn
Remove all the rows with empty job title
or company name. Will also remove all 
the empty colums. 

There is a invalid.txt. If any word from 
there matches any word in job title or 
company name, that particular row is also 
removed. 

Ultimately a database is obtained on which 
one can easily run a mailer for internship 
or job.
